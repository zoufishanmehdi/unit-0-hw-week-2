### 1. Objective-C Classes

You are provided with a `Person` class. This class has private properties `name`, `phoneNumber` and `city`, along with their getter and setter methods.

* Write a method called `checkSameCity` which accepts one parameter of type `Person *` and checks if they live in the same city. The function should return a boolean value.  
* A Person has recently had a child, whose name is 'Abc'. Write a method called `registerChild` which takes 0 parameters and returns a new `Person *` instance represeting the child, which has the same `phoneNumber` and `city` as the parent.

### 2. Cryptography : Caesar Cipher

The Roman General Julius Caesar used to correspond with his generals using a secret code. He devised a way of encrypting his messages using a simple encryption scheme now known as Caesar Cipher or Shift Cipher. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) and watch a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6TPx1Co_wg)

* You are given a class called `CaesarCipher` with methods `encode` and `decode`
* Being amateur codebreakers, we want to know if two distinct looking ciphers correspond to the same input message. Write a method called codeBreaker, which accepts two cipher strings as paramaters and returns a boolean value which tells us whether they are actually the same input message encoded using two different offsets. ***hint:*** the maximum offset is 25  
* There are multiple ways to do this. Try to come up with as many solutions as you can.

> **Example:**   
> okmg = "mike", offset 2    
> tprl = "mike", offset 7  
>
> Both are the same input message, but different offset. Your method would return YES in this case


### 3. BONUS : Voting System

You are given 3 classes

* **ElectionManager**
  * Conducts an election.
  * Controls start of voting
* **Election**
  * Maintains a list of contenders
* **Contender**
  *  Represents details about a contender
    *  What is the contender's name?
    *  How many votes has he received?

Write a program to simulate an election. Create a class called **VotingSimulator**. In the `main` function, you are required to do the following:

1. Create an **Election** object, and given the Election a `name`
2. Create a few **Contender** objects. ***Add*** these to the Election object. Make sure that the contender names are distinct!
3. Create a **ElectionManager** object. Ask it to **manage** the Election object created above.
4. Ask the ElectionManager to ***initiatePolling***
5. Follow the instructions on the console. After each round of polling you will be asked(within the console) whether you want to continue or not.
6. Ask the ElectionManager to ***displayResults***
